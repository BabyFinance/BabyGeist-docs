### BabyGeist is a reflection token

What is a reflection token? Reflection tokens tax every transaction and redistributes the collected tax to its holders. BabyGeist taxes 10% of every transaction. The following outlines the distribution of these taxes:

* 7% of every transaction is used to buy and redistribute Geist to its holders
* 2% is saved as a marketing budget
* 1% is added to liquidity

Hold BabyGeist and receive a portion of 7% of every transaction in Geist.

2% of every transaction is saved to a marketing budget that will be used to increase project awareness across several mediums and build the community. 

Deepening liquidity is important to assure buyers and sellers can sell with minimal price impact. BabyGeist's liquidity grows naturally with every transaction. Liquidity growth will also be encouraged via farms.
