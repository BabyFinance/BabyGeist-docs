# New to Fantom?

### MetaMask

You will need the MetaMask wallet to use the Fantom Opera network.  See [MetaMask's guide](https://metamask.io/download) for more info on how to install the MetaMask browser extension.

By default, the Fantom network will not be enabled on MetaMask. See a guide on how to enable Fantom's network [here](https://docs.fantom.foundation/tutorials/set-up-metamask).

### Faucets

To make a transaction you will need to have Fantom (FTM) in your MetaMask wallet.

If you are bridging from another network, you can use a community faucet to receive Fantom for gas.

Faucets can be found in the [SpookySwap](http://discord.gg/spookyswap) and [FTMAlerts](http://discord.gg/ftmalerts) Discords.
