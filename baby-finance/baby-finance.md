# BabyFinance

BabyFinance will be an ecosystem built around a few soon to be released tokens, BabyGeist & [BabyBomb](https://discord.gg/4szD5fUvB3), as well as baby NFTs.

BabyFinance will give all supported tokens some utility, and allow for interesting future features to be built around them. For example, BabyGeist NFTs will be stakeable along with other baby NFTs like BabyBoo Kittens and future mints to earn a portion of future BabyFinance tokens. Different NFT lines will have different weights within the staking model and some partners will be joining in as well, bringing utility to their current NFTs.

 We want to branch out from BabyGeist, and by giving baby tokens and NFTs on Opera a use case and connected ecosystem, we will be improving BabyGeist as well. We have many more exciting ideas that we would like to implement, for now NFT staking is our priority.

The move towards BabyFinance will be accompanied with a feature rich website for future NFT mints and pages going into detail about our tokens!
